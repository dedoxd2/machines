# Testing For File Upload  Methodology

## things u need to obesrve while u testing file upload vulnerablity

- Is the response time that the server takes to responde to ur request, some times servers sends ur file to a sandbaox to check if the file doesn't contain any malicious code before actually saving it to actuall file system of the server
- may the application is only validating content type

## Defense Techniques (Bypassing Techniques)

- Black list : -> use many different extensions till one gets bypass
- White list : -> use null byte technique : %00.jpg

- validating the content of the image : the server usually validating the magic bytes, in this case u might insert ur shell inside the image
