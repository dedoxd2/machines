# Lab: Username enumeration via subtly different responses

Description : This lab is subtly vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks.

End Goal : To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.

Analysis :

- i think since it not showing obvious sign to determin if the username is valid or not , we could use the time have been taken to process the request
- content length ,time to process
