# Lab: JWT authentication bypass via unverified signature

Description :  Due to implementation flaws, the server doesn't verify the signature of any JWTs that it receives.

End Goal : To solve the lab, modify your session token to gain access to the admin panel at `/admin`, then delete the user `carlos`.

creds : `wiener:peter`

just change ur username in the jwt using the jwt editor extension in the burpsuite
