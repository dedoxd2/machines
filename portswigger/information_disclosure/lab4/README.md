# Lab: Authentication bypass via information disclosure

This lab's administration interface has an authentication bypass vulnerability, but it is impractical to exploit without knowledge of a custom HTTP header used by the front-end.

To solve the lab, obtain the header name then use it to bypass the lab's authentication. Access the admin interface and delete the user `carlos`.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`
