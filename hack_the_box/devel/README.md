mfsvenom -> generate the payload for reverse shell
mfsconsole -> lestiner

serach suggester  -> find the module that suggest Exploits for privilage escalation ( u need to have a ruuning session first) ,
but note that : the suggester will only recommend exploitations based on the OS he dealing with but most of time we don't know what is the version of the OS , so u could try to use armitage
